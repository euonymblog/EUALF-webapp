Participants are invited to select one roundtable to attend in each session. This will be the opportunity to put forward ideas and recommendations. Each round-table has a chair and a rapporteur, and your active participation is encouraged.

The Research and Innovation Roundtable will cover issues such as:

* Where research and innovation fit into national agendas
* The Australia-EU relationship in research and innovation
* What we can do to strengthen joint work on research and innovation
